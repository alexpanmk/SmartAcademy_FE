# SMARTAcademy

SmartAcademy is a massive open online course platform which allows learners to take courses to upskill themselves. It also allows training providers to put up online courses.

The rational of choosing to do a MOOC platform is inspired by my previous role in Prudential working with L&D content. Also one of the main objective in taking this bootcamp to upskill myself is about building meaningful work.

## Key Challenges/Takeaways

### Figuring Inner workings of CLERK

- There is a lot of parts to the whole CLERK product. Will need to know how much of CLERK to incorporate into the capstone

### Time and Feasibility management

- Spent too much time on learning and trying to implement CLERK on both frontend and back end

## Next Steps

- UI Enhancement
  - Better UI .
- Monetisation (Purchase course or subscription)
- CLERK
  - To fully achieve both the clerk functionalities on front end and back end
  - to make full use of User managemnt tools in CLERK
- To add other data like images, video links etc
- To clean up backend
